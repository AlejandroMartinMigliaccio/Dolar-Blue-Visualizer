A very basic program to run a GUI that shows the current and historical price of the Argentine Blue Dollar.

The "Blue Dollar" is the parallel and unofficial market for buying and selling dollars in Argentina, 
with a higher exchange rate than the official one. It arises due to government exchange 
restrictions and its value is determined by supply and demand in this informal market.

The data is obtained from: https://api.bluelytics.com.ar/v2/evolution.json

In order to run this code you need to have installed:

-Python 3.11.4
-Pandas Library
-Matplotlib Library
-Tkinter Library
